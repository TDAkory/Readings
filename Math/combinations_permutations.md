# Combinations & Permutations

> Combinations : order doesn't matter
> Permutations : order matters

## Conclusion

* Combinations with repeats: $C_{n+r-1}^r$
* Combinations without repeats: $C_n^r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$
* Permutations with repeats: $n^r$
* Permutations without repeats: $P_n^r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
